jack_delay 0.4.2  -  25/08/2018

Maintenance release.


jack_delay 0.4.0  -  18/04/2011
-------------------------------

Jack_delay can be used to measure the round-trip latency of a soundcard.
To do this, start the program and connect like this:

jack_delay -> playback_port -> cable from soundcard output to input -> capture port -> jack_delay

Jack_delay generates a signal consisting of 13 sine waves, measures the
phase difference between the input and output for each of these, and
computes the delay from those phase differences. The algorithm used is
one developed originally for satellite ranging -  that is measuring the
distance between a satellite and a ground station.

With a good sound card jack_delay will measure the round-trip latency
with an accuracy of around 1/1000 of a sample. The assumption is that
the delay is more or less independent of frequency. The actual value
displayed is the one for a frequency of 1/16 of the sample rate. The
phase measurement for this frequency of course only provides a result
in the range of 0..16 samples. The other frequencies are used to extend
this interval to 4096 * 16 samples, more than a second at 48 kHz.
This release should be much less sensitive to frequency-dependent delay
than the previous ones. 

The following options are avaiable (use jack_delay -h to see them):

-O playback port   connect output to named port.
-I capture port    connect input to named port.
-E                 show excess latency instead of full latency.

Using -E requires -O and -I, as the the computation depends on
the latency values reported by jack for the ports used.
The excess latency is the measured value minus the expected one,
taking into account any corrections set by jack's -I and -O options.
That is, if you have the right values for these options, then the
value displayed with -E will be at most +/- half a sample.

To determine the correct values for jack's -I and -O, set both
of them to zero ('default' in qjackctl) and measure the latency
using the -E option. Then set each of the -I and -O options to
half the value displayed.
